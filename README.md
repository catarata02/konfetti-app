# Konfetti App

its an app for neighborhood help exchange - part of of the refugeehackathon, Berlin 2015


## Concept Notes

just install app - no sign up (hybrid, ios, android, ..) once app is released

app shows mirco support requests in your neighborhood (geolocation based)

everybody can get rewarded KONFETTI by
- doing those tasks
- donating goods

Konfetti is like Karma-Points

everybody who has konfetti can
vote-up other support requests
to make them more valuable
= throw your konfetti on it

neighborhood orga does
- curate task postings
- puts more konfetti on it

konfetti supply is endless - like love.

konfetti exchange goes:
- neighbor2refugee
- refugee2refugee
- refugee2neighbor

... you get the idea :D


## Building App from Source

Make sure to have the IONIC framework installed (v1.x): http://ionicframework.com

Checkout from git, run 'ionic state reset' and then 'ionic resources' with project folder.


## Running local Server

You need to have Maven installed. Check with 'mvn --version'.

To run server on localhost, go into 'api' folder and run 'mvn spring-boot:run'.


## Run App in local Browser (for development)

Run in project root folder 'ionic serve' - this will run the app in local browser for development.


## Actual State of Project

After 1 day of refugeehackathon.de we came from fresh new idea, group brainstorm, first design, throwing stuff away, going circles, fresh start, getting excited, testing idea, reducing it to the max, to:

- a group concept agreement
- smiling faces explaining the idea to others
- this first draft and mockups: https://github.com/rootzoll/konfetti-app/blob/master/concept/app-mockups.pdf
- first code commit: ionic hybrid app template

After 4 weeks of free time spend on the project:

- an almost ready click-prototype of the app - this will be awesome :)


## Next Steps

user building backend design and implementaion, ...

See OpenTasks here: https://trello.com/b/4xAQTPd0/konfetti (maybe tool of orga will change later on)


## Join & Meet

If you are a coder, designer or a helping hand on location - feel free to join in - newcomers welcome.

We like to meet at the Migration Hub Berlin but will also be around at the Chaos Communication Congress 2015 between christmas and new years at Hamburg.
