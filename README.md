# Konfetti App

## concept notes

just install app (hybrid, ios, android, ..) once app is released

app shows mirco support requests in your neighborhood (geolocation based)

everybody can get rewarded KONFETTI by
- doing those tasks
- donating goods

Konfetti is like Karma-Points

everybody who has konfetti can
vote-up support requests

= throw your konfetti on it

neighborhood orga does
- curate task postings
- puts more konfetti on it

konfetti supply is endless - like love.

konfetti exchange goes:
- neighbor2refugee
- refugee2refugee
- refugee2neighbor

... you get the idea :D

## Installation

Make sure to have the IONIC framework installed (v1). Checkout and run 'ionic state reset' and then 'ionic resources'.

## Actual State

After 1 day of refugeehackathon.de we came from fresh new idea, group brainstorm, first design, throwing stuff away, going circles, fresh start, getting excited, testing idea, reducing it to the max, to:

- a group concept agreement
- smiling faces explaining the idea to others
- this first draft
- first code commit: ionic hybrid app template

## Further Steps

user layout app, building dummy, backend design, ...

See OpenTasks here: https://trello.com/b/4xAQTPd0/konfetti (maybe tool of orga will change later on)

## Help needed

Next Meetup after the refugee hackathon will be at Bitcoin Stammtisch Berlin, 5th Nov @Room77/Kreuzberg, around 8pm
