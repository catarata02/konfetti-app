# Konfetti App

its an app for neighborhood help exchange - part of of the refugeehackathon, Berlin 2015

## Concept Notes

Everybody can get rewarded KONFETTI by
- doing those tasks
- donating goods

Konfetti is like Karma-Points. Everybody who has konfetti can vote-up other support requests to make them more valuable
= throw your konfetti on it

neighborhood orga does
- curate task postings
- puts more konfetti on it

konfetti supply is endless - like love.

konfetti exchange goes:
- neighbor2refugee
- refugee2refugee
- refugee2neighbor

... you get the idea :D

## Building App from Source

Make sure to have the IONIC framework installed (v1.x): http://ionicframework.com

Checkout from git, run 'ionic state reset' and then 'ionic resources' with project folder.


## Running local Server

You need to have Maven installed. Check with 'mvn --version'.

To run server on localhost, go into 'api' folder and run 'mvn spring-boot:run'.


## Run App in local Browser (for development)

Run in project root folder 'ionic serve' - this will run the app in local browser for development.
